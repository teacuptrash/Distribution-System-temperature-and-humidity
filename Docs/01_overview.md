# Project Overview and Motivation

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a secure end-to-end IoT system using real hardware.
Environmental monitoring using temperature and humidity sensors is a common IoT application in smart homes, agriculture, and industrial systems.

This project demonstrates:
- Real sensor data acquisition
- MQTT-based data communication
- Web-based visualization using Node-RED
- Network-layer security through authentication

The system is designed to be lightweight, modular, and scalable.
